### Game Description:


The Memory Master is an exciting game that assigns different sounds to keyboard letters. During the game, if a sound is played, the player must input the corresponding key. But that's not all! The player must also remember the sequence of sounds played, making it a more advanced and enjoyable version of the classic game, Simon Says.

### Game Modes:

In this game, there are different game modes that a player can choose from.
<br>
1. Duel Data Scores
2. The Last Survivor
3. Single Player
<br>

#### Duel Data Scores

This game mode can be run by pressing 1 on the keyboard at the start of the Memory Master game.
When playing Memory Master in play-alone mode your data is stored, now when you play duel data scores you can see if you can beat your friend's rank/score.

#### The Last Survivor

To access the Last Survivor game mode in Memory Master, simply press 2 on your keyboard at the beginning of the game. This game mode is designed for passing and playing with your friends, but instead of passing around a keyboard, it involves shifting and playing.

#### Single Player

To start the Memory Master game, press any keyboard button except 1 and 2. If you press enter without inputting any information, the game mode will default to single-player. Playing alone is the best way to achieve a higher rank/score. You can compete against imaginary characters and try to beat their rankings. The Memory Master is one of these characters and has the highest ranking/score. If you beat the Memory Master, you become the new Memory Master. Single-player mode allows you to level up and beat the Memory Master.
